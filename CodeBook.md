#CodeBook for tidyData.txt
This document describes the variables and data found in tidyData.txt

##Description of data
This data set provides the means of means and the means of the standard deviations for each subject and activity performed from a set of data collected via wearable devices. There were 6 activities performed by 30 subjects for a total of 180 activity/subject combinations. Each row in the tidy data set represents one activity/subject combination. Each column is the mean value of all the recorded values of that measurement type.

##Descriptions of variables
